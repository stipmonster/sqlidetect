This is a POC for a plugin that gives a alert when there is a possibility for a SQL injection. When it detects a possible SQLI it will popup a alert with the url, and a score that it has calculated for the url, the likelihood that there is a SQLI vuln.

Written for firefox.

-- tnx to habbie for the idea.
